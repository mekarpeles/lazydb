Ye Olde Bug Tracker
===================

(1) Right now, _writes are performed after each modification to the
flatfile using lazydb.

One known workaround for the first problem is to allow users to wrap a
batch or series of operations atomically within a lazydb.transact()
transaction (not yet implemented) and then lazydb.commit multiple
modifications at once.  This would drastically reduce file IO.

(2) In order to make _write perform (write out) correctly, the
connection to the file is closed and then re-oppened which is absurd.

I am not positive why this is happening yet. This issue simply
requires further investigation.
